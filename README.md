# nextjs-strapi
Boilerplate for Strapi CMS with Nextjs front-end seamlessly integrated via Nginx.

Each process is containerized for convenience. Simply run 'docker-compose up' in the root directory of this repo.

To use an already existing nextjs app, move './frontend/nextjs/Dockerfile' into the root of your nextjs app, then move so that the contents are available at './frontend/nextjs' (or modify the docker-compose file).

Documentation in progress.
